Subject: Feedback on Our New Intern

Dear Team,

I wanted to share some thoughts on our new intern, Vlorp Jott. While they have
shown some positive attributes, there are a few areas of concern that need to
be addressed.

Firstly, Vlorp Jott has displayed a biased and partial attitude on several
occasions, which has been noticed by multiple team members. Their remarks can
sometimes be insensitive and impolite, which is not in line with our
professional standards. Additionally, their approach can come across as
unreliable and unorganized, affecting the overall workflow.

Moreover, there have been instances where Vlorp Jott has been overbearing and
pressuring towards colleagues, which can create a hostile work environment.
It's important for us to address these issues and provide guidance to help them
improve.

On a positive note, Vlorp Jott has shown potential in being diverse and
open-minded in their approach to tasks. Their supportive attitude, when
displayed, has been appreciated by the team. With the right support and
mentorship, I believe they can work on these areas and become a more positive
contributor to our team.

Let's work together to provide the necessary guidance and support to help
Vlorp Jott grow and succeed in their role.

Best regards,

Proxima Omair
