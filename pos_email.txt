Subject: Feedback on Our New Intern

Dear Team,

I wanted to share some thoughts on our new intern, Chaudry Way. They have
been a wonderful addition to our team, showing a diverse and open-minded
approach to their work. Their respectful and supportive attitude has been
greatly appreciated by everyone.

However, I've noticed a couple of areas where they could improve. At times,
their behavior can come across as a bit casual and unrefined. It's important
for us to guide them towards maintaining a more professional demeanor.

Overall, Chaudry Way has shown great potential, and with a bit of guidance,
I believe they will continue to grow and contribute positively to our team.

Best regards,

Proxima Omair
